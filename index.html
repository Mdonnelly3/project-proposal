            What Was Included/What I would have included with more time.
        </h5>
        <p>Technical Features; </p>
        <ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>I Included a few python works, as well as some works of my own that honestly, I just wanted to share. </li>
            <li>If I had more time I WOULD TOTALLY HAVE KEPT ADDING TO THIS and I will keep adding to this because its a lot of fun. Unfortunately, 
         with the craziness that is working during finals week, I didnt have as much time as I thought I would to finish everything to the degree
         I wanted. I want to keep working on it and I will 100%, but I want to finish linking all my pages to one another, I wanted to add all of the
         art pieces in, and I want to figure out a way to finallllyyy sucessfully get the home page hosted.</li>
            <li>Generative art- this made me the most frustrated because it looks super fun, I thought I had all the downloads needed to 
             get it to work but alas; I did not. Mark my words though, I will get it working over this break. It has more than peaked
             my curiosity./li>
